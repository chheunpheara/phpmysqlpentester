### Very small Pentest Project

PHP and Mysql Attack

1. Inject Login Form
2. Inject Query String
3. Remote File Inclusion
4. XSS Attack ==> Todo
5. Session Hijack ==> Todo

### Installation
- create a database and copy the schema from `schema/schema.sql`
- copy `config/Database.sample.php` to `config/Database.php`

### Todo:
- Implement more topics for the web application attacks
- Put more UI design (It is now very ugly)


#### Note:
- If `remote file inclusion` does not work, please allow `allow_url_include=On`.
Once this works, it will overwrite `index.php`. After the test, you can copy `index.php.ori` to `index.php` to rollback the replacement.

- Source codes are written very ugly. Feel free to modify.
